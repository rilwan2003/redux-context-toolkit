# Project Title: Redux vs Context API vs Redux Toolkit

## Project Description

This project aims to compare three popular state management solutions in React: Redux, Context API, and Redux Toolkit. It will demonstrate the differences and similarities between each solution by implementing the same functionality in each of them. The project will also explore the benefits and drawbacks of each solution.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- Context API
- Redux Toolkit

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Comparison of Solutions

The project will implement the following functionality in each solution:

- Display a list of items retrieved from an API.
- Allow the user to add new items to the list.
- Allow the user to delete items from the list.

### Redux

The Redux implementation will use the standard Redux pattern with actions, reducers, and a store. It will use the `redux-thunk` middleware to handle asynchronous API requests.

### Context API

The Context API implementation will use the `useContext` hook to manage state. It will use the `useEffect` hook to make API requests.

### Redux Toolkit

The Redux Toolkit implementation will use the `createSlice` function to create a reducer with simplified syntax. It will use the `createAsyncThunk` function to handle API requests.

## Conclusion

After implementing the functionality in each solution, the project will compare the differences and similarities between them. The project will also provide insights on when to use each solution based on the project's requirements.
